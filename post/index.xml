Intro The Disney BRDF was introduced by Brent Burley as part of the SIGGRAPH 2012 Physically Based Shading course and then extended to a BSDF with integrated subsurface scattering for the SIGGRAPH 2015 Physically Based Shading course. While the model is not strictly physically based it was designed with physically based principles in mind and each of the terms included was done so to fit the model to materials in the MERL 100 database.</description>

If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in path tracing you&amp;rsquo;ve probably also at least heard of both bidirectional path tracing (BPT) and photon mapping (PM). Both algorithms were introduced in the 1990s and gave us powerful new tools for solving problems in areas where unidirectional path tracing was weak. However, despite the advancements they offered, neither algorithm saw wide adaptation in film due to some weaknesses of their own.</description>

      <title>Sampling the Solid Angle of Area Light Sources</title>

With ray tracing mania taking over thanks to the announcement of DXR now seems like a great time for me to write about the next subject I wanted to write about: sampling the solid angle of area lights. While the concept was described in research at least two decades ago I&amp;rsquo;ve found that most books and blog posts that mention sampling area lights tend to describe sampling the surface area of the light source.</description>

      <title>Importance Sampling techniques for GGX with Smith Masking-Shadowing: Part 2</title>
      <link>https://schuttejoe.github.io/post/ggximportancesamplingpart2/</link>

      <description>In Part 1 of this post I showed a common method for importance sampling the GGX distribution of normals using the inverse of the CDF of the distribution. While this clearly converged faster than importance sampling a cosine lobe it did still leave a number of fireflys in the image that would be pesky to deal with. Additionally, there is a hidden inefficency that is causing us to potentially waste a number of samples.</description>

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing about importance sampling the GGX BRDF. GGX used with the Smith masking-shadowing function has become ubiquious in the game industry so it was the first specular model I wanted to implement in the path tracer I&amp;rsquo;m writing. About two weeks before I wrote this blog post I sat down and googled &amp;ldquo;importance sampling ggx&amp;rdquo; and while I was able to find a number of articles and papers that described specific details of the technique I was left a little unsure about whether I was combining the pieces together correctly.</description>

      <description>My name is Joe Schutte and I&amp;rsquo;ve been a graphics and engine programmer in the game industry for a bit over ten years now. I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been dedicating a significant amount of my spare time towards reading research papers with a focus on rendering for film as well as writing an offline renderer using what I&amp;rsquo;ve read about. This blog will be a medium for me to write about any interesting subject that I encounter and believe might be helpful to share with others.</description>
