My name is Joe Schutte and I've been a graphics and engine programmer in the game industry for a bit over ten years now. I've recently been dedicating a significant amount of my spare time towards reading research papers with a focus on rendering for film as well as writing an offline renderer using what I've read about. This blog will be a medium for me to write about any interesting subject that I encounter and believe might be helpful to share with others.
