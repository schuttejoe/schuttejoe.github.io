Hello and welcome to the first entry in my [blag](https://xkcd.com/148/)! Pardon me while I remember how to write things coherently. As a quick introduction, my name is Joe Schutte and I've been a graphics and engine programmer in the game industry for a bit over ten years now. I've recently been dedicating a significant amount of my spare time towards reading research papers with a focus on rendering for film as well as writing an offline renderer using what I've read about. This blog will be a medium for me to write about any interesting subject that I encounter and believe might also be helpful to share with others.

Today I'll be writing about importance sampling the GGX BRDF. GGX, also called Trowbridge-Reitz, used with the Smith masking-shadowing function has become ubiquious in the game industry so it was the first specular model I wanted to implement in the path tracer I'm writing. This subject has been covered in other blogs but those I've seen have left out details about how to correctly use their outputs. Additionally, Eric Heitz and Eugene D'Eon have published some wonderful research in the last few years that made improvements on the technique so hopefully by writing about that in part 2 I am able to show something new for everyone.

I'm pretty sure there's a rule that you need to include the rendering equation in your first blog post. Or maybe it was for good luck? Either way, I'm going to lead with that and try to make use of it.

$$ \Lo(X, \wo) = \Le(X, \wo) + \int_\Omega \Li(X, \wi) ~ f(\wi, \wo) ~ | \wg \cdot \wi | ~ d\wi $$

When evaluating the irradiance for a single ray hit in a path tracer we want to zoom in on the interior of that integral. Furthermore, we know that $\Li(X, \wi)$ will be information gathered by casting a ray in direction $\wi$ so we just want to focus here on choosing direction $\wi$ and then solving for $f(\wi, \wo) ~ | \wg \cdot \wi |$. As is fairly typical, $f(\wi, \wo)$ is the Cook-Torrance microfacet BRDF described by:

$$\f(\wi,\wo) = \frac{\F(\wi,\wm) ~ \G_2(\wi,\wo,\wm) ~ \D(\wm)}{4 ~ |\wi\cdot\wg| ~ |\wo\cdot\wg|}$$

used with the GGX distribution of normals for $\D$($\wm$) and the Smith masking-shadowing function for $\G_2(\wi,\wo,\wm)$. These equations are written as:

	$$\D(\wm) = \frac{\a^2}{\pi((\wg \cdot \wm)^2(\a^2-1) + 1)^2}$$
	$$\G_2(\wi, \wo) = \frac{2 ~ (\wm \cdot \wi) ~ (\wm \cdot \wo)}{ (\wm \cdot \wo) \sqrt{\a^2 + (1-\a^2)(\wg\cdot\wi)^2} + \wg \cdot \wi \sqrt{\a^2 + (1 - \a^2)(\wg \cdot \wo)^2}}$$

If you really want to dig into what the Cook-Torrance model means and understand where it came from I highly recommend reading [Understanding the masking-shadowing function in microfacet-based BRDFs](http://jcgt.org/published/0003/02/03/paper.pdf) from Eric Heitz . $\D(\wm)$ is defined there and $\G_2(\wi, \wo)$ can be found as the uncorrelated version of the Smith Masking-Shadowing function in [PBR Diffuse Lighting for GGX+Smith Microsurfaces](https://twvideo01.ubm-us.net/o1/vault/gdc2017/Presentations/Hammon_Earl_PBR_Diffuse_Lighting.pdf) from Earl Hammon, Jr.

Now back to describing the problem we are solving. We have a surface roughess $\a$, an outgoing direction $\wo$, and a geometric normal $\wg$ from our surface. Both of those vectors will have been transformed to tangent space so $\wg$ will actually be just our up direction. In my case, that is the Y axis. We want to choose a direction $\wi$ with probability proportional to the amount of energy leaving in direction $\wo$ to sample and to solve for the reflectance.

---

The first technique I want to write about is to importance sample only $\D(\wm)$. This is quite effective since the distribution of normals does have a significant impact on the directions you want to sample. To importance sample $\D(\wm)$ we will use the inverse of the CDF of $\D(\wm)$ to generate a microfacet normal $\wm$. If you are familar with using GGX in game rendering this can be thought of as creating a half vector in tangent space. The derivation of the inverse of the CDF is covered in detail in Cao Jaiyin's post [here](https://agraphicsguy.wordpress.com/2015/11/01/sampling-microfacet-brdf/) so I'll just refer you to that for the details and list the relevant equations here:

	$$\theta_m = \arccos\sqrt{\frac{1 - \xi_0}{\xi(\a^2 -1) + 1}} ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\phi = 2 \pi \xi_1$$

Now, if you remember how importance sampling works, you'll know that we are eventually going to need to divide our result by the pdf of the sample we take. As we will see the convienance of later, the pdf for generating the spherical coordinates is very similar to the distribution of normals itself. From Cao's post we have:

	$$\p_m(\theta_m, \phi) = \frac{\a^2\cos\theta\sin\theta}{\pi((\a^2 - 1)\cos^2\theta + 1)^2}$$

where $\cos\theta$ can be written as $(\wg \cdot \wi)$ and we can substitude in $\D(\wm)$ to get

	$$\p_m(\theta_m, \phi) = \D(\wm)(\wg \cdot \wi)\sin\theta$$

The next step we'll want to take is to transform these spherical coordinates into Cartesian coordinates. With one last reminder that I am using Y-up, here are the equations for that:

	$$\textit{x} = \textit{r}\sin\theta\cos\phi$$
	$$\textit{y} = \textit{r}\cos\theta$$
	$$\textit{z} = \textit{r}\sin\theta\sin\phi$$

where r=1 in this case. This gives us $\wm$.

And now we get to a step that people sometimes gloss over. I'm kinda going to do that too but I want to at least mention it :). When we generate a sample with some distribution and then apply a transformation to that sample, we end up with a different distribution (unless the transformation was the identity). We need to account for that by modifying the pdf as well. This is done in an N dimensional case by dividing the pdf by the absolute value of the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of the transformation. Unfortunately, I don't have a web link that shows more detail on this but you can see section 13.5 of the second edition of the book Physically Based Rendering for details. So, the determinant of the Jacobian of our transformation from spherical to Cartesian coordinates is:
	
	$$|\textit{J}_T| = \textit{r}^2\sin\theta$$

which when we divide from the pdf $\p_m(\theta_m, \phi)$ with r still equal to 1 we can see that we've canceled out a term and we have:

	$$\frac{\p_m(\theta_m, \phi)}{|\textit{J}_T|} = \D(\wm)(\wg \cdot \wi)$$

Ok, back to finding $\wi$. Now that we have our microfacet normal $\wm$ we can use that to calculate the light direction $\wi$ that we want to sample by reflecting our view vector $\wo$ by $\wm$. This is the final step for generating $\wi$ but note that we've done another transformation when we reflected the vector so we're going to need to divide the pdf by the determinant of that Jacobian as well. The equation for reflection and the determinent of the Jacobian of that transformation is given by:

	$$\wi = 2|\wo \cdot \wm|\wm - \wo$$
	$$|\textit{J}_R| = \frac{1}{4|\wo \cdot \wm|}$$

which when we divide from the pdf from earlier we get

	$$\frac{\p_m(\theta_m, \phi)}{|\textit{J}_T||\textit{J}_R|} = \frac{\D(\wm)(\wg \cdot \wi)}{4|\wo \cdot \wm|} = \p(\wm)$$

So there's our $\wi$ and now we have everything we need to solve for the reflectance. From the beginning we have the cook-torrance BRDF which we will divide by the pdf we calculated to generate $\wi$.

	$$\frac{\f(\wi,\wo)| \wg \cdot \wi |}{\p(\wm)} = \frac{\frac{\F(\wi,\wm) ~ \G_2(\wi,\wo,\wm) ~ \D(\wm)| \wg \cdot \wi |}{4 ~ |\wi\cdot\wg| ~ |\wo\cdot\wg|}}{\frac{\D(\wm)(\wg \cdot \wi)}{4|\wo \cdot \wm|}}$$

Conviently you can see that a *lot* of terms cancel out here and we're left with only this for our reflectance:

	$$\frac{\f(\wi,\wo)| \wg \cdot \wi |}{\p(\wm)} = \frac{\F(\wi,\wm) \G_2(\wi,\wo,\wm) |\wo \cdot \wm|}{|\wi \cdot \wg| |\wm\cdot\wg|}$$

From here we will transform $\wi$ from the tangent space we've been working in back to world space, cast a ray in that direction to solve for incoming energy $\Li(X, \wi)$, and multiply that by the reflectance we calculated here.

Time for some pictures! 

![In order to have something to compare to on the left I generated an image by importance sampling a cosine distribution and on the right I generated an image using the technique described above. The scene is the Stanford bunny with roughness 0.05 lit only with an environment light. Both images were generated with 1024 rays per pixel.](GgxImportanceSamplingImages\CosineVsGgxD.jpg)

As you can see the results are significantly better than importance sampling with just a cosine lobe. However, there are still quite a few fireflys visible in the image so this technique would require a lot more samples to converge. In my next post I will talk about why we still see so many fireflys and about a more recent technique from Eric Heitz and Eugene D'Eon to importance sample the distribution of visible normals.

One last thing before we move on to part 2 is source code!
